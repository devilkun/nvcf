# Local Development (k3d)

Run a full NVCF self-hosted stack on your laptop using
[k3d](https://k3d.io/) for development, testing, or demos. The canonical
local-k3d tooling lives at `tools/ncp-local-cluster/` in this repo.

<Info>
This setup is only for local development. It uses fake GPUs, a single
Cassandra replica, and ephemeral storage. Do not use this for production
workloads.
</Info>

Clone the public repository before using any local development flow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nvidia/nvcf.git
cd nvcf
```

## Pick a flow

Four canonical flows are covered below: pick a topology from
[Topologies](#topologies) and an install path from
[Install paths](#install-paths).

| Topology | Install path |
|---|---|
| Single-cluster | CLI (`nvcf-cli self-hosted install`) |
| Single-cluster | Helmfile (`make install HELMFILE_ENV=...`) |
| Multi-cluster | CLI (`nvcf-cli self-hosted install`) |
| Multi-cluster | Helmfile (`make install HELMFILE_ENV=...`) |

## Topologies

Single-cluster topology: This brings up one k3d cluster named `ncp-local`. Control
plane and compute plane share the cluster. The fastest path for
function-lifecycle testing and basic install validation.

Multi-cluster topology: This brings up `ncp-local-cp` plus `ncp-local-compute-N`
(N=1 by default). Control plane lives on the cp cluster; compute plane on
the compute cluster. Required when you need to exercise cross-cluster
registration, the OIDC/JWKS discovery flow, or the `.test` hostname
routing the cp Gateway exposes to compute workers.

The two topologies cannot run at the same time. Both claim host ports
8080/8443/4222. Destroy one before bringing up the other:

```bash
# from single-cluster -> multi-cluster
make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy

# from multi-cluster -> single-cluster
make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster
```

## Install paths

CLI path: The profile-and-values workflow installs the control plane, writes a
control-plane profile, registers the compute plane, and installs the generated
compute-plane values. For a repository-built CLI, run these commands from the
repository root:

```bash
nvcf-cli self-hosted \
  --control-plane-stack deploy/stacks/self-managed \
  install --control-plane

nvcf-cli init

nvcf-cli self-hosted \
  --compute-plane-stack deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane \
  compute-plane register \
  --control-plane-profile deploy/stacks/self-managed/out/control-plane-profile.yaml \
  --cluster-name <cluster-name> \
  --kube-context <compute-plane-context>

nvcf-cli self-hosted \
  --compute-plane-stack deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane \
  compute-plane install \
  --values deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/out/<cluster-name>-register-values.yaml \
  --kube-context <compute-plane-context>
```

The alternative `self-hosted install --compute-plane` command registers the
cluster itself before applying the compute-plane manifests. Do not run
`cluster register` before that combined command. Use one compute-plane workflow
or the other.

Repository-built CLI binaries do not contain the stack OCI defaults injected
into packaged releases. The commands above pass the required stack explicitly.
Use both stack directories from the same checkout. The CLI selects in-cluster
or cross-cluster URLs from the kube contexts you pass.

Helmfile path: Helmfile drives the install through split Make targets:
`deploy/stacks/self-managed/Makefile` for control plane (`make template`,
`make install`) and `deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/Makefile` for
compute plane (`make register-cluster`, `make install`). The operator authors
topology-correct URLs into an environment file (different fixture per
topology) instead of relying on a CLI-managed profile.

The two install paths intentionally diverge. See
`tests/bdd/AGENTS.md` (the "CLI vs Helmfile install paths" section) for
the rationale.

## Prerequisites (common to all flows)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (running)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/#installation) v5.x or later
- `kubectl`
- `helm` >= 3.12
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.24.0 (required to build `nvcf-cli`)
- `helmfile` >= 1.1.0, < 1.2.0
- `helm-diff` plugin:
  `helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff`
- An NGC API key with access to the NVCF chart and image registry.
- `nvcf-cli` built from this repo:

  ```bash
  go build -C src/clis/nvcf-cli -o ../../../nvcf-cli .
  ```

## Cleanup

The BDD suite ships destructive cleanup helpers reused for hand-driven
local dev:

| Scope | Command |
|---|---|
| Stack-only (helm releases) on single-cluster | `tests/bdd/scripts/destroy-stack.sh single` |
| Stack-only on multi-cluster | `tests/bdd/scripts/destroy-stack.sh multi` |
| Whole single-cluster topology | `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy` |
| Whole multi-cluster topology | `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster` |
| Every `ncp-local*` k3d cluster on the host | `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-all-ncp-local` |
