# PROTOTYPE. One-time, in-place relocation of a Bitnami-nested Cassandra data
# volume to the OSS Cassandra layout, so the volume no longer needs a subPath
# and every future upgrade is a normal deploy.
#
# Bitnami stored data nested under the mount:
#   <DATA_DIR>/data/{data, commitlog, hints, saved_caches}
# OSS Cassandra uses:
#   <DATA_DIR>/{data, commitlog, hints, saved_caches}
# This moves the nested contents up one level. It is idempotent (a second run
# is a no-op), guarded (refuses ambiguous state), and dry-run by default.
#
# Env:
#   DATA_DIR  mounted volume path (default /var/lib/cassandra)
#   DRY_RUN   "true" prints the plan and changes nothing (default true)
