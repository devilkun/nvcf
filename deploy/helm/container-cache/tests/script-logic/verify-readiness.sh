# Behavioural tests for the DaemonSet readiness helpers.
#
# The helpers live inside the Helm-templated bash script in
# templates/daemonset.yaml, so this test renders the chart, lifts the shipped
# function definitions out of the rendered script, and runs them for real
# against fixture files. Only the two path roots are rewritten (/proc and
# /host point at a temporary directory); the logic under test is the exact
# text that ships in the DaemonSet.
#
# Run from the chart subtree:
#   bash tests/script-logic/verify-readiness.sh
