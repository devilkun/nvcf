# Per-asset request and byte counters. Two properties matter and neither is
# obvious from reading the rendered config:
#
#   1. Every file and byte range of one model, repo, or bucket collapses to a
#      single label value, so a model pulled as hundreds of 512MiB ranges is one
#      series rather than hundreds.
#   2. Requests the cache never consulted are counted as NONE rather than
#      dropped. On a live sample those were 45.6 percent of requests and 786
#      GiB, and the older metric block skipped all of them.
#
# Run from the chart subtree:
#   bash tests/chart-render/verify-asset-metrics.sh
