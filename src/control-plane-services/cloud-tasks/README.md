# NVIDIA Cloud Tasks

Multi-module repository for REST APIs and gRPC worker APIs
for NVIDIA Cloud Tasks (NVCT) service. NVCT manages the
lifecycle of run-to-completion workloads, such as model
fine-tuning, TensorRT engine builds, and batch inference,
on GPU-powered worker nodes.

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| [nvct-core](nvct-core/) | Core module with business logic |
| [nvct-service](nvct-service/) | Spring Boot executable depending on `nvct-core` |

## Minimum Requirements

- [Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK 25](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
- [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Development Environment

### Build from command-line

```bash
export BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/nvcf-bazel-cache"
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/...
```

Run all commands from the monorepo root. See [BAZEL.md](BAZEL.md) for detailed
build, test, coverage, NOTICE, executable jar, and container workflows.

#### TestContainers Failing on Linux

On Linux, if Bazel tests fail because
TestContainers are not starting, you may see an error like:

```text
ContainerLaunchException: Timed out waiting for container port to open
```

This can happen if the `Userland Proxy` service has been
disabled. Enable it in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "userland-proxy": true
}
```

By default this service is enabled and should be left
enabled for Java TestContainers to work on Linux.

### Run NVCT Service from command-line

Once the service is built successfully, you can run the
service from the command-line:

1. Set up Cassandra:

    ```bash
    docker compose \
      -f src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/local_env/docker-compose.yml \
      up -d
    ```

   This starts Cassandra locally.

2. Run the service from the command line with the `local` profile:

    ```bash
    java -Dspring.profiles.active=local \
      -jar bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/app.jar
    ```

The service uses the following ports:

- HTTP/REST endpoints are exposed on port 8080.
- gRPC endpoints are exposed on port 9090.
- Management/Actuator endpoints are exposed on port 8181.

Actuator / management port is typically not exposed to the load balancer.

The `/health` endpoint is also exposed on the main HTTP port without authentication.

## Run the app from IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the monorepo root as a Bazel project.
2. Open `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Build Tools` >
   `Bazel`.
3. Set `Project View Path` to
   `<monorepo-root>/tools/intellij/.managed.bazelproject` and sync the
   project.
4. Run `@//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:app_run` from
   the Bazel tool window or the gutter beside `App.main()`.
5. Open the generated `Bazel` run configuration. Keep `Run with Bazel`
   selected.
6. Add these values to `CLI arguments to your application`, replacing the
   example root with the absolute path to this checkout:

   ```text
   --jvm_flag=-Dspring.profiles.active=local
   --jvm_flag=-Dnv-boot.reloadable-properties.file=file:/absolute/path/to/nvcf/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/local_env/vault/secrets.json
   ```

Start Cassandra as described above before running the target. Bazel runs the
application from its runfiles tree, so the secrets file must use an absolute
path. Do not set `-Duser.dir`; it breaks Bazel's relative Java classpath.
