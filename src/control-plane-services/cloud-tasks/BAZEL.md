# Bazel

Cloud Tasks lives inside the `NVIDIA/nvcf` monorepo. Run every command in this
document from the monorepo root, not from this subtree. The monorepo copy is
Bazel-only and does not contain project POMs. Any Maven build support remains
in the independent source repository. Bazel configuration and dependency locks
are owned by the monorepo root.

For the Bazel path, Cloud Tasks consumes nv-boot through direct first-party
labels such as:

```text
//src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/nv-boot-starter-core:nv_boot_starter_core
```

Bazel does not publish Maven-shaped Cloud Tasks or nv-boot jars. Bazel
consumers use source targets in this checkout.

Set one OS-neutral Bazel output root when opening a shell in this repository:

```bash
export BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/nvcf-bazel-cache"
```

The commands below reuse this variable. It resolves under the operating
system's temporary directory instead of assuming the macOS-specific
`/private/tmp` path.

## Bazel in Maven terms

Cloud Tasks keeps the usual Maven directory layout. Bazel gives the same files
different build names.

| Maven idea | Bazel idea |
|---|---|
| A Maven module | A directory with a `BUILD.bazel` file, called a package |
| A POM dependency | An entry in a target's `deps` list |
| A plugin or parent-POM convention | A shared Bazel macro |
| A Maven goal | A Bazel target selected by a label |
| `mvn test` | `bazel test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/...` |

A label contains the package path before the colon and the target name after
it. For example:

```text
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:nvct_core
```

## Project structure and targets

```text
cloud-tasks/
  BUILD.bazel                 component-wide test data
  nvct-core/
    BUILD.bazel
    src/main/java/            reusable core code
    src/main/resources/       core resources, when present
    src/test/java/            core tests
    src/test/resources/       core test resources
  nvct-service/
    BUILD.bazel
    src/main/java/            Spring Boot application code
    src/main/resources/       application resources
    src/test/java/            service tests
    src/test/resources/       service test resources
```

Keep one `BUILD.bazel` file at each Maven-like module root. Do not add package
boundaries below `src/main/java` or `src/test/java`. That keeps Java packages,
resources, and IntelliJ roots together.

The important core targets are `nvct_core`, `tests`, and `tests_coverage`. The
important service targets are `app_classes`, `app`, `tests`,
`tests_coverage`, and `nvct-service-oss-image`.
`nvct-service` depends on the `nvct_core` library target in the same way that a
Maven application module depends on its core module.

## Shared Java macros

Both modules load shared macros from `//rules/java:defs.bzl`:

- `nvcf_java_library` compiles Java into a reusable library. The core module
  names that library `nvct_core`. The service module names it `app_classes`
  because the Spring Boot packaging target consumes it.
- `nvcf_java_test` is a macro that declares one native `java_test` target.
  The normal target name is `tests`. Bazel and IntelliJ use this same target.
- `nvcf_java_coverage_test` is a macro that declares the separate
  `tests_coverage` target. It runs `tests` and writes JUnit and JaCoCo reports
  for CI. Its `coverage_target` points to the production library covered by
  the tests.
- `spring_boot_app` turns the service's `app_classes` into an executable jar.
- `java_oci_image` turns the application into a container image.

Core and service modules use the same library and test macros because the
Bazel operations are the same. The module role is shown by its directory and
target names, not by a separate macro name.

## Bazel terms by example

These terms describe different parts of the same declaration:

| Term | Meaning | Cloud Tasks example |
|---|---|---|
| Macro | A Starlark function that writes one or more rule calls for us | `nvcf_java_test(...)` |
| Rule | A Bazel building block that knows how to create an output | `java_test(...)` inside `//rules/java:defs.bzl` |
| Target | One named object created by a rule | `tests` in `nvct-core` |
| Label | The full Bazel address of a target | `//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests` |

For example, `nvct-core/BUILD.bazel` contains this kind of macro call:

```starlark
nvcf_java_test(
    name = "tests",
    srcs = NVCT_CORE_TEST_SRCS,
    deps = NVCT_CORE_TEST_DEPS,
)
```

The macro contains the actual `_java_test(...)` call. `_java_test` is a private
name for the standard `java_test` rule from `rules_java`. That rule declares
the `//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests` target.

The core library follows the same idea. Its `nvcf_java_library(...)` macro call
declares `//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:nvct_core`. The
`nvct-service` `app_classes` target lists that label in `deps`. This is the
Bazel equivalent of the Maven service module depending on the core module.

The separate `nvcf_java_coverage_test(name = "tests_coverage", ...)` macro call
declares an `sh_test` target. It runs `tests` for CI reports but does not own
the Java test source files.

## IntelliJ-compatible BUILD structure

The JetBrains Bazel plugin learns source roots from Bazel targets. Follow these
rules when changing either module:

1. Give each `src/main/java` tree exactly one IDE-visible library owner.
2. Give each `src/test/java` tree exactly one IDE-visible native Java test
   owner. A compatibility fixture library may compile the same files only when
   it sets `ide_visible = False` and produces a downstream artifact.
3. List `src/main/resources` only as production resources.
4. List `src/test/resources` only as test resources.
5. Keep the helper resource targets generated by the shared macros. IntelliJ
   uses them to classify Resources Root and Test Resources Root correctly.
6. Keep coverage and report targets separate from the native Java test. They
   must not own Java source files.

The canonical project view is `tools/intellij/.managed.bazelproject`. Its
directory list includes Cloud Tasks. The active file under `.bazelbsp` must
enable `rules_java`, derive targets from directories, and allow manual targets
to sync. These settings are needed because the IDE and CI targets have
different jobs.

After changing a `BUILD.bazel` file, run a Bazel project resync in IntelliJ.
Do not mark roots manually because the next sync replaces those settings. A
correct sync marks main sources, test sources, main resources, and test
resources.

The Project view shows the filesystem, so Java packages can look like ordinary
directories there. Select Packages from the Project tool window's view menu to
see the Java package hierarchy. In Packages view, open the Options menu and
turn off Modules. Otherwise, IntelliJ shows Bazel targets such as
`app_classes` and `tests_coverage` as module names. Turn off Library Contents
too if external jars make the view noisy. Use Packages view for Java packages
and the Bazel tool window for Bazel targets.

Each `nvcf_java_test(name = "tests")` macro call declares exactly one native
`java_test` target named `tests`. This same-name rule lets the JetBrains Bazel
plugin offer gutter test actions. The new plugin does not add a per-test Run
action to the Java editor context menu. JetBrains tracks that feature gap in
[BAZEL-2755](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2755). Right-click
actions remain available on targets in the Bazel tool window. Use
`tests_coverage` when JUnit or JaCoCo report files are required.

## Understanding the Dependency Files

Bazel uses three root files for dependency declarations and locking. A
simple way to remember their responsibilities is:

```text
MODULE.bazel       = what the whole monorepo wants
maven_install.json = exact third-party Java artifacts that were resolved
MODULE.bazel.lock  = exact Bazel modules and module extensions that were resolved
```

### `MODULE.bazel`

Developers edit the root `MODULE.bazel`. Cloud Tasks does not have a nested
module file. The root file declares inputs such as:

- `bazel_dep` entries for Bazel rules and tooling;
- Maven-compatible BOMs and third-party Java dependency roots supplied to
  `rules_jvm_external`;
- the shared `nv_third_party_deps` hub configuration; and
- checksum-pinned repositories for native build tools that are not Java
  dependencies.

For someone familiar with Maven, this file serves some of the roles of the
root `pom.xml`, dependency management, and build-plugin configuration, but it
is not a POM and does not use Maven parent inheritance.

### `maven_install.json`

Do not edit this file manually. `rules_jvm_external` generates it when the
shared third-party hub is pinned. It records the resolved Java artifacts,
transitive dependency relationships, repository locations, checksums, and an
input signature.

Its name contains `maven` because the external Java artifacts use Maven
coordinates and come from Maven-compatible repositories. It does not run a
Maven build, publish Cloud Tasks artifacts, or make the Bazel outputs
Maven-shaped. Maven does not normally have a direct checked-in equivalent to
this dependency lockfile.

The `__INPUT_ARTIFACTS_HASH` and `__RESOLVED_ARTIFACTS_HASH` sections contain
signed 32-bit Java hash values used to detect dependency-input and resolution
drift. Negative numbers there are normal. They are not artifact checksums;
artifact integrity is recorded separately as hexadecimal SHA-256 values under
each artifact's `shasums` entry.

After changing BOMs, third-party roots, or versions in the root `MODULE.bazel`,
regenerate it with:

```bash
REPIN=1 bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  run @nv_third_party_deps//:pin
```

### `MODULE.bazel.lock`

Do not edit this file manually. Bazel generates and updates it for Bzlmod. It
locks the Bazel module graph and module-extension evaluation used to create
external repositories. For example, it records resolution associated with
rules such as `rules_java`, `rules_spring`, and `rules_jvm_external`; it is not
the lockfile for the Spring, Jackson, or other Java jars listed in
`maven_install.json`.

Normal Bazel commands update this file when Bzlmod inputs change.

### Commit Rules

Commit all three files. When a dependency change updates more than one of
them, commit those changes together. The normal workflow is:

1. Edit `MODULE.bazel`.
2. Repin `maven_install.json` when the third-party Java graph changes.
3. Run the build and tests, allowing Bazel to update `MODULE.bazel.lock`.
4. Review and commit every changed dependency file; never hand-edit either
   lockfile.

## Prerequisites

- Bazel 9.1.1 through Bazelisk honoring the root `.bazelversion`.
- Java 25. The root `.bazelrc` selects the local Java 25 JDK for compilation
  and runtime.
- Docker is required for the current `nvct-core` and `nvct-service`
  integration tests.

In `.bazelrc`, an option beginning with `common` applies to commands such as
`query`, `cquery`, `build`, and `test`; an option beginning with `build` applies
only to build and commands that inherit build options. The `rules_spring`
external Java-rule compatibility option is therefore under `common`, while the
Lombok header-compilation setting remains under `build`.

The root `.bazel_downloader_config` maps external downloads to approved
mirrors. Bazel applies it automatically through `.bazelrc`; Cloud Tasks should
not define a subtree-specific downloader configuration.

## Dependency Updates

### The Single Dependency Hub

A third-party dependency hub is the external Bazel repository created by
`rules_jvm_external`. It contains targets for external jars such as Spring,
Jackson, gRPC, and Guava. `rules_jvm_external` currently obtains those jars
from Maven-compatible repositories, but that is an implementation detail of
dependency resolution, not the meaning of the hub name.

The monorepo root defines exactly one install:

```python
maven.install(
    name = "nv_third_party_deps",
    ...
)
use_repo(maven, "nv_third_party_deps")
```

In simple terms:

1. The root `MODULE.bazel` lists the third-party roots needed across Java
   libraries and applications.
2. `rules_jvm_external` resolves them as one graph.
3. BUILD files use labels from the generated `@nv_third_party_deps`
   repository.
4. The root `maven_install.json` locks the selected artifacts and checksums.

The name `nv_third_party_deps` is intentionally agnostic about build tool,
resolver, and runtime. The hub contains only third-party dependency targets.
It does not contain `nv-boot-parent`, `nvct-core`, or `nvct-service`; those are
consumed and built as first-party Bazel source targets. It also does not imply
that Bazel creates or publishes Maven-shaped project artifacts.

`maven.install.name` names the generated hub. `use_repo` makes that generated
repository visible to BUILD files as `@nv_third_party_deps`.

Do not add a second hub in a service subtree. Multiple hubs can select
different versions of the same library and create an incompatible runtime.
A coordinate's presence in the root hub only makes its Bazel target available;
it reaches Cloud Tasks compilation or runtime only when a BUILD dependency
edge selects it.

Therefore, add required roots to the existing root install and repin it. Do
not use `git_override`, `local_path_override`, or `--override_module` between
nv-boot and Cloud Tasks: both are ordinary directories in the same Bazel
module.

### Updating Dependencies

After changing third-party roots or versions in the root `MODULE.bazel`,
repin with:

```bash
REPIN=1 bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  run @nv_third_party_deps//:pin
```

Then run the normal build and tests. Commit `MODULE.bazel` and
`maven_install.json` together. Commit `MODULE.bazel.lock` too if Bzlmod changes
it.

Cloud Tasks intentionally pins gRPC runtime and code generation to 1.63.0.
`rules_proto_grpc_java` 5.8.0 bundles a newer 1.74 generator, so
`//rules/java:proto.bzl` keeps the upstream compile implementation but selects
the matching 1.63 executable fetched by checksum-pinned `http_file`
repositories. These native executables intentionally stay outside
`nv_third_party_deps`, which has `fetch_sources = True` for Java
dependencies. `rules_jvm_external` 7.0 cannot repin that setting when an
executable-classifier artifact advertises a missing source jar. When upgrading
gRPC, change the single `GRPC_VERSION`, update all platform checksums, repin,
and rerun the full test suite.

Use the same output root for local commands so Bazel cache/output data stays
outside the checkout:

```bash
--output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}"
```

## Build Everything

Build all Cloud Tasks targets:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/... \
  --verbose_failures
```

Bazel builds dependencies automatically. You do not need to run a separate
build before `bazel test` unless you want compile-only feedback.

## Build `nvct-core`

Build the main `nvct-core` library:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:nvct_core \
  --verbose_failures
```

The current Bazel library jar is:

```text
bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/libnvct_core.jar
```

Build the `nvct-core` test-fixtures target consumed by `nvct-service` tests:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:nvct_core_test_fixtures \
  --verbose_failures
```

The fixture label is a compatibility `java_library` target. Managed
`nvct-service` builds depend on its label and exact output name:

```text
bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/libnvct_core_test_fixtures.jar
```

The library keeps the `local_env/` files in the classpath layout expected by
downstream tests. Its `no-ide` tag keeps it out of the IntelliJ project model.
The native `tests` target remains the IDE owner of `src/test/java`, so the Run
gutter stays available. Do not replace the fixture library with an alias to
`tests`; an alias changes the jar name and pulls monorepo-only runfiles into
external Bzlmod consumers.

## Build `nvct-service`

Build the private `nvct-service` application classes target for compile-only
feedback:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:app_classes \
  --verbose_failures
```

That target exists only to compile the Spring Boot application classes/resources
and to feed tests and packaging. It is not a product artifact.

Build the Bazel-native Spring Boot executable jar:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:app \
  --verbose_failures
```

The app jar is:

```text
bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/app.jar
```

The jar is produced by `//rules/java:spring.bzl`, which delegates Spring
Boot executable packaging to `rules_spring` and then injects the small set of
metadata files that Maven plugins used to contribute:

```text
BOOT-INF/classes/git.properties
BOOT-INF/classes/maven.properties
META-INF/maven/com.nvidia.nvct/nvct-service-oss/pom.properties
```

The metadata merge uses the platform-specific `singlejar` executable supplied
by `rules_java`. It must not invoke a host `jar` command or depend on
`JAVA_HOME`: CI images can provide Bazel and Java 25 while omitting JDK utility
commands from `PATH`.

It keeps Spring Boot loader classes at the jar root and places runtime jars
under `BOOT-INF/lib`. This `app.jar` is the monorepo's executable application
artifact.

`git.properties` is generated from Bazel workspace status, replacing the app
jar portion of `git-commit-id-maven-plugin` behavior for the Bazel path. The
current generated keys match the keys used by nv-boot startup code:

```text
git.closest.tag.name
git.commit.id.abbrev
git.commit.id.full
git.tags
```

Quick local launch smoke:

```bash
java -jar bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/app.jar \
  --spring.main.web-application-type=none \
  --spring.main.banner-mode=off \
  --logging.level.root=OFF \
  --spring.main.lazy-initialization=true
```

Without `spring.profiles.active`, this is expected to fail during nv-boot
environment validation. That failure still proves the app jar can load the
Spring Boot launcher, app classes, and runtime dependencies.

## Build and Run the Docker Image

Run these commands from the monorepo root.

First, build the Spring Boot executable jar:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:app \
  --verbose_failures
```

Resolve the real Bazel output directory and use the `nvct-service` output
directory as the Docker build context:

```bash
BAZEL_BIN_DIR="$(
  bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" info bazel-bin
)"

docker build \
  -f src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg APP_JAR=app.jar \
  -t cloud-tasks-nvct-service:bazel \
  "${BAZEL_BIN_DIR}/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service"
```

Using the resolved output directory is necessary because the workspace
`bazel-bin` path is a symlink to Bazel's output tree outside the repository.
Docker cannot follow that symlink through a repository-root build context.

Start the local Cassandra dependency:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/local_env/docker-compose.yml \
  up -d
```

Run the application container with the `local` Spring profile:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --name nvct-service \
  --mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks,target=/home/app,readonly" \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local \
  -e SPRING_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=host.docker.internal \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  cloud-tasks-nvct-service:bazel
```

The repository bind mount makes `local_env/vault/secrets.json` available at
`/home/app/local_env/vault/secrets.json`. The Cassandra contact point uses
Docker Desktop's host address because `127.0.0.1` inside the application
container refers to the application container itself.

After stopping the application, stop the local Cassandra dependency:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/local_env/docker-compose.yml \
  down
```

## Test Everything

Run all current Bazel test targets without using cached test results:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/... \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH \
  --verbose_failures
```

Current Bazel test targets are:

```text
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests_coverage
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:tests
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:tests_coverage
```

The module tests and their coverage targets are tagged `exclusive` because
they use the same fixed-port local integration environment. Without that, a
scoped wildcard test can run them in parallel and collide on ports such as
WireMock `9092`. The native `tests` targets are also tagged `manual`, so a
wildcard test runs only the corresponding coverage targets.

## Test `nvct-core`

Run the full `nvct-core` test target:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH \
  --verbose_failures
```

The full `nvct-core` test target currently runs JUnit through
`org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher`.

## Test `nvct-service`

Run the `nvct-service` Spring Boot smoke/integration test target:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH \
  --verbose_failures
```

The test target starts the `App` context with the `nvct-core` test fixture
configuration and validates `/health` plus `/actuator/health`.

## Test One Test File

Convert the test source path to its fully qualified class name.

Example:

```text
src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/src/test/java/com/nvidia/nvct/service/apikeys/ApiKeyValidationResultTest.java
```

becomes:

```text
com.nvidia.nvct.service.apikeys.ApiKeyValidationResultTest
```

Run only that test class:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH \
  --test_arg=--exclude-classname='^(?!com\.nvidia\.nvct\.service\.apikeys\.ApiKeyValidationResultTest$).*$' \
  --verbose_failures
```

Replace the class name in the regular expression for other test files. Keep
dots escaped as `\.`.

## Test One Method

Run one test method by combining a class filter with a method-name filter:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH \
  --test_arg=--exclude-classname='^(?!com\.nvidia\.nvct\.service\.apikeys\.ApiKeyValidationResultTest$).*$' \
  --test_arg=--include-methodname='.*#allAllowedTasksAccount$' \
  --verbose_failures
```

For parameterized tests, use the Java method name; JUnit will run the matching
invocations for that method.

Example:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_arg=--exclude-classname='^(?!com\.nvidia\.nvct\.service\.apikeys\.ApiKeyValidationResultTest$).*$' \
  --test_arg=--include-methodname='.*#allAllowedTasks$' \
  --verbose_failures
```

## Test Logs

Bazel writes test logs under:

```text
bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/<module>/tests/
```

Useful files:

```text
bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/tests/test.log
bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/junit/TEST-junit-jupiter.xml
bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/tests/test.log
bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/tests_coverage/test.outputs/junit/TEST-junit-jupiter.xml
```

The Jupiter XML files contain the real Java testcases and are the reports
published by GitHub Actions. The nearby `tests_coverage/test.xml` files
describe Bazel's outer `sh_test` wrapper and must not be used as JUnit reports.

Use `--cache_test_results=no` when you want to force the tests to run again.

Use `--test_output=streamed` instead of `--test_output=errors` when you want to
watch test output live:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=streamed \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH
```

## Coverage And Sonar XML

Coverage generation belongs to the separate report targets. Run:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test \
  //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core:tests_coverage \
  //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:tests_coverage \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors \
  --test_env=DOCKER_HOST \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY \
  --test_env=DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR \
  --test_env=DOCKER_CERT_PATH
```

This refreshes these outputs:

The test JVM runs the JaCoCo agent with `dumponexit=true`. After JUnit exits,
the Bazel shell test preserves the JUnit status and invokes the Bazel-declared
JaCoCo CLI to generate XML and HTML. This uses no custom Java coverage launcher
and no JaCoCo internal runtime API.

Open `index.html` for the JaCoCo HTML report. Sonar consumes the corresponding
`jacoco.xml`, for example:

```text
-Dsonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/jacoco.xml,bazel-testlogs/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service/tests_coverage/test.outputs/jacoco.xml
```

Class and method filters also produce reports, but those reports describe only
the selected test execution.

## License/NOTICE Generation

The monorepo has two NOTICE levels:

1. Cloud Tasks' Bazel target generates and checks the complete third-party
   NOTICE for the application.
2. The existing root `tools/scripts/collect-notices` process records the Cloud
   Tasks NOTICE path in the monorepo's top-level `NOTICE`.

Cloud Tasks derives its actual shipped coordinates from the jars nested in:

```text
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/nvct-service:app
```

The root owns the shared rule and generator under `//rules/java` and
`//tools/bazel/java`. Cloud Tasks owns:

```text
src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/NOTICE
src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/notice_metadata.json
```

Cloud Tasks does not need `notice_roots.json`: the executable `app.jar` is the
authoritative runtime closure. Its metadata file contains only dependencies
additional to nv-boot. The shared rule reads common metadata from:

```text
//src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent:notice_metadata.json
```

It selects only shared entries actually present in `app.jar`, merges the
service-owned entries, and fails on missing, conflicting, or duplicated
metadata. The generated Cloud Tasks NOTICE is complete and standalone; it is
not a concatenation of or link to nv-boot's NOTICE.

Regenerate the checked-in NOTICE:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  run //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks:generate_notice -- --write
```

When a new service runtime dependency lacks metadata, refresh only the
service-owned metadata and NOTICE:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  run //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks:generate_notice -- \
  --update-metadata --write
```

The metadata-update mode may read an upstream dependency POM from the local
Maven cache or configured artifact repository to obtain its published name,
URL, and license declaration. That is metadata discovery only; it does not run
a Maven project build.

Check NOTICE drift exactly as CI does:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks:notice_check_test \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors
```

Build the complete runtime inventory and NVBug-ready dependency delta:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build \
  //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks:cloud_tasks_runtime_inventory \
  //src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks:osrb_dependency_delta

cat bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/runtime_inventory.json
cat bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/osrb_dependency_delta.json
cat bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/osrb_dependency_delta.md
```

The delta compares exact versioned Cloud Tasks runtime coordinates with the
nv-boot runtime inventory and groups only the additional dependencies by
normalized license. Use that Markdown as the dependency portion of the NVBug
6040004 approval comment. Ambiguous and custom license expressions remain
explicit for OSRB review.

After component NOTICE files are updated, validate the existing monorepo root
rollup:

```bash
./tools/ci/check-license
```

`check-license` requires Bash 4 or newer. To intentionally refresh the
top-level path rollup, run `./tools/scripts/update-license`.

## GitHub CI

The monorepo uses `.github/workflows/bazel.yml`. There are no GitLab
`ENABLE_BAZEL_*` variables for this subtree.

The detector models Cloud Tasks, nv-boot, and shared Java changes, but current
policy deliberately runs the full matrix on every PR and push. If change-aware
scheduling is restored later, those relationships select the appropriate
service lane. The build-container lane excludes `requires-docker` tests at
query time. The Docker-host lane receives Java 25 through
`actions/setup-java`, uses the host Docker daemon, and runs the complete Cloud
Tasks test scope, including unit and Testcontainers tests. Changes to nv-boot
or shared Java tooling must also select Cloud Tasks as a reverse-dependency
validation target.

GitHub CI proves build, test, coverage, and layered NOTICE behavior. Public
container publication remains a separate release-policy decision. Bazel never
publishes Maven-shaped project artifacts.

The component-local `bazel-java-ci.json` registers Cloud Tasks with the root
workflow. The detector infers the component path from that file. A future Java
service adds its own descriptor with:

```json
{
  "ci_lane": "docker-host",
  "component_kind": "java-service",
  "id": "service-id",
  "tests_skip": false
}
```

That one descriptor supplies shared Java triggers, nv-boot reverse-dependency
validation, CI execution-environment routing, and report upload. Do not add the
service name to parallel lists in `.github/workflows/bazel.yml`.

### CI Execution Environments

The `ci_lane` descriptor field has two supported values:

- `build-container`: GitHub Actions runs the job inside the pinned
  `ghcr.io/nvidia/nvcf/bazel-ci` image. Its build tools are preinstalled, but
  it does not expose the host Docker daemon. Use it only when the component's
  complete test scope does not require Testcontainers or Docker commands.
- `docker-host`: GitHub Actions runs directly on the `ubuntu-latest` virtual
  machine. The workflow installs Java and Bazelisk, and Docker is available.
  Cloud Tasks uses this lane because its tests start Cassandra containers.

This distinction belongs to the GitHub CI environment, not to Bazel itself.
On a developer machine, tests that require containers need a working Docker
daemon. Docker Desktop and Docker Engine are supported options. Under the
current one-lane-per-component policy, a
component with even one `requires-docker` test uses `docker-host` for its
complete suite. A Java component with no Docker-dependent tests may use
`build-container`.

### Bazel Scope

Cloud Tasks is part of the monorepo root Bazel module. CI invokes Bazel from
the repository root with:

```text
//src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks/...
```

The descriptor no longer contains `scope_mode`. Earlier,
`scope_mode: root` stated that CI must run from the monorepo root instead of
entering Cloud Tasks and expecting a nested `MODULE.bazel`. All Java components
now use that root scope implicitly. Some existing non-Java components remain
independent nested Bazel modules, but that is not a supported option for Java
components integrated into this monorepo.

### Downloading CI Reports

Open the completed GitHub Actions workflow run and download:

```text
bazel-cloud-tasks-verification-<run-attempt>
```

The artifact is retained for 14 days and contains:

```text
generated/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE
generated/runtime_inventory.json
generated/osrb_dependency_delta.json
generated/osrb_dependency_delta.md
testlogs/nvct-core/tests/test.log
testlogs/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/junit/TEST-junit-jupiter.xml
testlogs/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/jacoco.exec
testlogs/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/jacoco.xml
testlogs/nvct-core/tests_coverage/test.outputs/index.html
testlogs/nvct-service/tests_coverage/test.outputs/...
```

Use the XML under `test.outputs/junit`; Bazel's outer `test.xml` describes the
shell test wrapper rather than the individual JUnit tests. The root-owned
`tools/ci/stage-bazel-java-artifacts` helper copies through Bazel's `bazel-bin`
and `bazel-testlogs` symlinks so the download contains real files after the CI
runner is destroyed.

## Bazel-only monorepo policy

Cloud Tasks project POMs are migration evidence in the independent source
repository and are not copied into this monorepo. Build, test, packaging,
dependency management, NOTICE generation, and CI use Bazel here. Do not restore
project POMs or add monorepo Maven build instructions.

## Clean

Clean Bazel outputs for this workspace:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" clean
```

Use `expunge` sparingly because it removes the whole output base and forces
dependency/tool re-fetching:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" clean --expunge
```
