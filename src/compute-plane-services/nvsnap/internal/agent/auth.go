// Authentication for the agent's HTTP API.
//
// The API is the control surface of a privileged process: it restores and
// deletes checkpoints, serves any file inside a checkpoint, and exposes pprof.
// The DaemonSet binds it to the node's IP (hostNetwork + hostPort 8081), and
// NetworkPolicy cannot fence it -- a hostNetwork pod carries node identity, so
// podSelector ingress rules do not match it. Access control therefore has to
// live in the request path.
//
// A shared bearer token rather than mTLS: this same router serves the peer
// fan-out endpoints that move multi-GB checkpoints, and TLS handshakes amortize
// with connection reuse but per-byte encryption does not. A header comparison
// costs nothing on the transfer path. See GH #486.
