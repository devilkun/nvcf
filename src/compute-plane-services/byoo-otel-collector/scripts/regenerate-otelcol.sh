# Regenerate the otelcol/ tree from otel-collector-build.yaml using the
# OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (ocb).
#
# When to run:
#   - After bumping OpenTelemetry module versions in
#     otel-collector-build.yaml.
#   - After adding/removing receivers/processors/exporters/extensions in
#     otel-collector-build.yaml.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Installs ocb at the version pinned below into a per-run tempdir
#      (so this works without polluting GOBIN).
#   2. Runs ocb with --skip-compilation (we want sources, Bazel builds
#      the binary).
#   3. Moves the 6 emitted files into otelcol/.
#
# The drift detector at tools/ci/check-otelcol-generated re-runs this
# script into a tmp dir and diffs vs the checked-in otelcol/ to fail
# CI when the YAML has been edited without regenerating.

# Pinned to the OpenTelemetry release line that all the receivers/
