## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. Code changes must include tests, or the pull request must
   explain why tests are not applicable.
3. Run the Bazel tests from the monorepo root:
   `bazel test //src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/... --cache_test_results=no --test_tag_filters=-requires-docker`.
4. Sign your commits with `git commit -s`.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the change.

## Reporting Issues

Please use the project's issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
Include as much detail as possible.

## Java code style

This document complements the repository's Bazel Java configuration.

### Copyright and license headers

- Java sources must use the block comment (`/* ... */`) SPDX header found in
  neighboring Java files.
- `.properties` files must use the equivalent `#`-prefixed SPDX header.
- `META-INF/spring/*.imports` files, including
  `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`, must use
  the `#`-prefixed SPDX header.
- If Legal updates the template, apply the new wording project-wide (new and touched files at minimum).

### Language and platform

- Target the Java and Spring Boot versions declared by the root Bazel module.
  Prefer APIs available on that baseline. Avoid preview features unless the
  build explicitly enables them and the team agrees.

### Style and formatting

- Follow the formatting rules enforced by the build (e.g. Spotless, formatter plugin). When in doubt, match existing modules in this repo.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Java unless the formatter dictates otherwise.
- Prefer explicit imports over star imports; keep imports ordered consistently with the rest of the tree.
- Line length: stay within the limit enforced by Checkstyle/Spotless (or ~100-120 columns if no tool is configured), breaking only where readability improves.

### Naming and structure

- Packages: lowercase, no underscores; align with existing `com.nvidia.nv.boot.*` layout.
- Classes: `PascalCase`; methods and fields: `camelCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- One top-level public class per file, named after the file.
- Keep classes focused: prefer small types and composition over large "god" classes.

### Spring Boot and dependency injection

- Prefer constructor injection for required collaborators; use `@Autowired` on the constructor when the class is a Spring-managed bean with multiple dependencies.
- Avoid field injection for mandatory dependencies unless there is a documented reason (e.g. framework limitations).
- Configuration properties should use typed `@ConfigurationProperties` where appropriate, with validation (`@Validated`, `@NotNull`, etc.) when values are required.

### APIs and visibility

- Minimize public surface area: prefer package-private or internal types until an API is intentionally stable.
- Use Javadoc on public types and non-obvious public methods - describe behavior, parameters, return values, and thrown exceptions, not redundant restatements of the method name.

### Error handling and logging

- Throw specific, meaningful exceptions; avoid bare `Exception` or `RuntimeException` for domain errors when a dedicated type exists or should exist.
- Log at appropriate levels (`error` for failures requiring attention, `warn` for recoverable issues, `debug`/`trace` for diagnostics). Do not log secrets or full payloads that may contain PII unless required and approved.

### Testing

- Add or update unit tests for behavior changes; use the same testing stack as sibling modules (JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Test, etc.).
- Prefer readable test names (`methodConditionExpected`) and Arrange-Act-Assert structure.

### Security and robustness

- Do not hardcode secrets; use configuration or secret management appropriate to the deployment environment.
- Validate external input at boundaries (HTTP, messaging, file uploads).
- Be careful with serialization and reflection on user-controlled data; follow Spring and Jackson safe defaults.

### Pull requests

- Keep changes scoped to the task; avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- Update documentation and tests when behavior or public APIs change.
