# crates/pylon-lib

`pylon-lib` owns pylon backend sidecar behavior. A pylon is the former `stargate-client`: it manages registration streams, reverse tunnels, local upstream forwarding, request observation, metrics, bringup calibration, and active canaries.

## Local Invariants

- The QUIC tunnel requires `x-request-id`, `x-model`, and `x-input-tokens`; missing required headers return HTTP `400` and must not be forwarded upstream.
- Treat `x-request-id` as the canonical globally unique request identity. Do not synthesize replacement local request IDs.
- `x-stargate-retryable`, `x-stargate-retry-reason`, and `x-stargate-retry-after-ms` are response metadata emitted by the pylon, not caller request headers.
- `x-stargate-expected-queue-ms` is internal request metadata emitted by Stargate only. Strip it before forwarding upstream and never trust a caller-supplied value.
- Queue mismatch retry responses are local pylon admission decisions and must use pylon-emitted retry response metadata.
- Request observation assumes streamed responses. Derive output progress from SSE `data:` events, not non-streaming JSON bodies.
- Terminal request-observer transitions are invariants. Calling terminalization from a terminal state should fail loudly.
- Model advertisement is gated by both caller-provided status and bringup lifecycle state.
- Reverse-tunnel connectivity gates advertisement per stargate even when local model calibration has completed.

## Bringup And Canaries

- Bringup calibration runs against the local upstream HTTP server, not the advertised `inference_server_url`.
- When the advertised URL is `quic://...`, callers must also supply the direct local HTTP base URL.
- Calibration runs only after Stargate assigns this pylon as the cluster calibration owner, then seeds the sticky published `last_mean_input_tps`; `CalibrationState` remains the proof of coordinated completion.
- Active canaries begin only after active advertisement.
- The built-in canary is the deterministic `1+1=` chat request. Completion exactly at `canary_max_generation_threshold` is treated as runaway generation and demotes the model.

## Metrics

- Keep pylon metrics in `src/metrics.rs` using the per-process `PylonMetrics` registry.
- Model gauges should be emitted for request-observation updates and KV-cache poll-only updates.
- Preserve terminal request counters and token histograms for all terminal outcomes.
