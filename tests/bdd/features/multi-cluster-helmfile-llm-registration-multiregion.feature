Feature: Register an LLM worker securely with routers in two local regions
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want recursive router discovery to retain explicit HTTPS transport,
  so that one worker can register with routable Deployment and StatefulSet routers across regions.

  Rule: A secure remote Watch URI expands the registered router topology

    Background:
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name            |
        | NGC_API_KEY     |
        | NVCF_CLI        |
        | REPO_ROOT       |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
