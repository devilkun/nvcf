Feature: Install local Helmfile observability with the compute profile
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to install the compute observability profile on a local split-cluster
  topology,
  so that the compute plane exports workload and NVCA metrics without running
  control-plane-only observability components.

  Background:
    Given these environment variables are set:
      | name            |
      | NGC_API_KEY     |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      | NVCF_CLI        |
      | REPO_ROOT       |
    # Helmfile pulls OCI charts during installation. Authenticate before sync
    # without exposing the current API key in command arguments or logs.
    And Helm is authenticated to OCI registry "nvcr.io" using the current NGC API key
    # Install only control-plane prerequisites on ncp-local-cp. Shared
    # observability is installed separately on the compute cluster below.
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd-observability-compute" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd-multi.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | addons.llm.enabled              | false                                |
      | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
    # Configure the shared observability stack for compute-plane monitors.
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd-observability-compute" for stack "observability" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd-multi.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | observability.profile           | compute                              |
    # Configure NVCA to use the same compute observability profile.
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd-observability-compute" for stack "nvcf-compute-plane" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd-multi.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name                       | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository                        | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository                               | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.nvcaOperator.selfManaged.otelCollector.enabled | true                                 |
      | observability.profile                                 | compute                              |
    And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-observability-compute-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
    # Conflict precheck: single-cluster ncp-local claims host ports used by the
    # split topology. From the repository root, run
    # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy CLUSTER_NAME=ncp-local`
