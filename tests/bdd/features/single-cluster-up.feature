Feature: Bring up a local single-cluster NVCF stack with the CLI
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to install a single-cluster control plane and compute plane
  on a local k3d cluster, so that I can validate the install + register
  workflow before using real infrastructure.

  Rule: install --control-plane installs the CP; compute-plane register/install completes the worker layer

    Background:
      # SAMPLE_NGC_ORG / SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM are consumed by
      # `make build-and-deploy-cluster` (the credential provider
      # validation step) when the `a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is
      # running` step runs the build target. Without them, that target
      # fails at CREDENTIAL PROVIDER VALIDATION and skips the gateway
      # API setup.
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name            |
        | NVCF_CLI        |
        | NGC_API_KEY     |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      # self-hosted install --env local reads the operator-authored
      # control-plane secrets file. Only secrets.yaml.template is tracked.
      # Prepare local-secrets.yaml from that template before running
      # install/register. Ledger snapshots whatever
      # local-secrets.yaml state existed before the first write (its
      # prior contents or absence) and restores or removes it at suite
      # teardown, so the working tree stays clean.
      And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
      # --env local also reads operator-authored environment values from
      # both split stacks: deploy/stacks/<stack>/environments/local.yaml.
      # Neither file is tracked, so author both from the BDD fixtures.
      # observability.profile is disabled because this workflow runs
      # 'helmfile apply', whose diff phase validates rendered manifests
      # against the live cluster (--dry-run=server); on a fresh cluster
      # the ServiceMonitor CRDs do not exist yet and the diff fails
      # before anything installs. The Helmfile workflow (helmfile sync)
      # has no diff phase and keeps the default profile.
      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
        | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local" for stack "nvcf-compute-plane" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
        | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
      # Conflict precheck: ncp-local-cp's k3d serverlb claims
      # 0.0.0.0:8080/8443/10081, NATS on 4222, and the worker
      # callback port 10086, overlapping host ports single-cluster
      # ncp-local needs. Fail loudly here so the operator runs
      # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster`
      # before retrying this feature, rather than discovering the
      # port collision deep inside the build-and-deploy-cluster
      # make target. `k3d cluster get` exits 1 when the named
      # cluster is absent (k3d v5).
      And I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local-cp"
      And the command exit code should be 1
      And a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is running
      # nvcf-cli self-hosted install renders helmfile manifests that
      # reference imagePullSecrets: [{name: nvcr-pull-secret}]. Create
      # the secret in each NVCF namespace before install so pods can
      # pull nvcr.io images. The step is idempotent (kubectl apply).
      # Real users were running this loop manually before reaching the
      # install command.
      And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:
        | cassandra-system |
        | nats-system      |
        | nvcf             |
        | api-keys         |
        | ess              |
        | sis              |
        | vault-system     |
        | nvca-operator    |
        | cert-manager     |
