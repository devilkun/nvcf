Feature: Install a local single-cluster stack with upstream supporting images
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want the documented upstream image overrides to survive Helmfile rendering
  and installation,
  so that I can use the public supporting images without relying on their NGC
  mirrors.

  Background:
    Given these environment variables are set:
      | name            |
      | NGC_API_KEY     |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      | REPO_ROOT       |
    And file "tools/ncp-local-cluster/secrets/docker-config.json" exists
    # Conflict precheck: ncp-local-cp claims host ports that overlap with the
    # single-cluster topology. Run
    # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster` before retrying.
    When I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local-cp"
    Then the command exit code should be 1
    Given I copy the file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/Makefile.dist" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/Makefile"
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
    And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
    And I substitute a block in file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/global.yaml.gotmpl":
      """
        reloader:
          image:
            registry: {{ .Values.global.image.registry }}

    And a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is running
    And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:
      | cassandra-system |

  Scenario: Operator renders and installs the stack with upstream supporting images
