Feature: Install a local single-cluster NVCF stack with Helmfile
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to use the documented Helmfile workflow against a local k3d cluster,
  so that I can install a single-cluster control plane with NVCA, the LLM
  gateway, and Vanity Gateway add-ons enabled.

  Rule: Operator authors the local Helmfile environment file

    Background:
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name            |
        | NGC_API_KEY     |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
        | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      # The fixture is a copy of deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/local.yaml,
      # which already carries every ncp-local local-mode override (storageClass,
      # replica counts, NVCA self-managed endpoints, addons.llm.*, agentConfig,
      # ingress.gatewayApi.*, addons.vanityGateway.*). The Background only overlays the operator-specific
      # values that vary per NGC org and pull-secret name.
      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name               | nvcr-pull-secret                                                   |
        | global.helm.sources.repository                | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}                               |
        | global.image.repository                       | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}                               |
        | observability.profile                         | disabled                                                           |
      And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd" for stack "nvcf-compute-plane" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
        | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
        | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
        | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
      And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential

    Scenario: Operator validates the authored Helmfile environment renders
      When I successfully run command "make -C deploy/stacks/self-managed template HELMFILE_ENV=local-bdd"

      Then the command output should not contain "Error:"

  Rule: Helmfile installs the local control plane with gateway add-ons

    Background:
      # This rule depends on the earlier environment-authoring
      # scenario in the same feature run. That scenario writes
      # local-bdd.yaml and local-bdd-secrets.yaml. Do not repeat that
      # setup here. The @llm-gateway scenario is not a standalone tag
      # target.
      # Conflict precheck: ncp-local-cp's k3d serverlb claims
      # 0.0.0.0:8080/8443/10081, NATS on 4222, and the worker
      # callback port 10086, overlapping host ports single-cluster
      # ncp-local needs. Fail loudly so the operator runs
      # `make -C tools/ncp-local-cluster destroy-multicluster`
      # before retrying. `k3d cluster get` exits 1 when absent (k3d v5).
      Given I run command "k3d cluster get ncp-local-cp"
      And the command exit code should be 1
      And a single-cluster ncp-local cluster is running
      And the "nvcr-pull-secret" image pull secret exists in namespaces:
        | cassandra-system |
        | nats-system      |
        | nvcf             |
        | api-keys         |
        | ess              |
        | sis              |
        | vault-system     |
        | nvca-operator    |
        | cert-manager     |

    @llm-gateway
    Scenario: Operator installs the control plane through the local Helmfile environment
      When I successfully run command "make -C deploy/stacks/self-managed install HELMFILE_ENV=local-bdd"

      Then these Helm releases should be deployed using context "k3d-ncp-local":
        | name                      | namespace            |

        | api                       | nvcf                 |
        | nvct-api                  | nvcf                 |
        | invocation-service        | nvcf                 |
        | grpc-proxy                | nvcf                 |
        | ess-api                   | ess                  |
        | notary-service            | nvcf                 |
        | admin-issuer-proxy        | api-keys             |
        | reval                     | nvcf                 |
        | nats-auth-callout-service | nats-system          |

        | vanity-gateway            | nvcf                 |

      Then these Gateway API routes should be accepted and resolved using context "k3d-ncp-local" within "2m":
        | kind      | name           | namespace            | parent    |
        | HTTPRoute | vanity-gateway | envoy-gateway-system | shared-gw |

      When I successfully run command "kubectl --context k3d-ncp-local get configmap/nvcf-api-remote-config -n nvcf -o yaml"
      Then the command output should contain "llm-router-client-image: nvcr.io/${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM}/pylon:"

  Rule: Helmfile installs NVCA on the same local cluster after registration via the stack Makefile

    Background:
      Given these environment variables are set:
        | name      |
        | NVCF_CLI  |
        | REPO_ROOT |
      # This rule depends on the earlier control-plane install scenario

      And I successfully generate a function API key with CLI options:
        | option        | value                                                                       |
        | --description | bdd-openai-compatible-sample                                                 |
        | --scopes      | invoke_function,list_functions,queue_details,list_functions_details         |

      # The gateway answers synchronously (no queue polling). The
      # sample always returns its fixed load-testing message.
      When I successfully invoke model "openai-compatible-sample" at "/v1/chat/completions" with timeout "120" seconds:
        """
        {"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"bdd-llm-echo"}]}
        """
      Then the command output should contain "chat.completion"
      And the command output should contain "fixed 128-byte response"

      # curl reports only the status code so the assertion cannot
      # match response-body noise.
      When I successfully run command:
        """
        curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://llm.localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"unauthenticated/check","messages":[]}'
        """
      Then the command output should contain "401"

      # Leave the GPU capacity free, same as the echo scenarios.
      And I successfully undeploy the function selected by NVCF CLI
