Feature: Render local Helmfile stacks with observability disabled
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to render both local Helmfile stacks with observability disabled,
  so that I can verify the profile does not add observability resources.

  Background:
    Given these environment variables are set:
      | name            |
      | NGC_API_KEY     |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_ORG  |
      | SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM |
      | REPO_ROOT       |
    # Helmfile pulls OCI charts during rendering. Authenticate before render
    # without exposing the current API key in command arguments or logs.
    And Helm is authenticated to OCI registry "nvcr.io" using the current NGC API key
    # Create the self-managed stack environment used by the control-plane render.
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd-observability-disabled" for stack "self-managed" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
    And I prepare self-managed secrets file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/local-bdd-observability-disabled-secrets.yaml" from template "deploy/stacks/self-managed/secrets/secrets.yaml.template" using the current NGC registry credential
    # Create the compute-plane stack environment used by the worker render.
    And I prepare Helmfile environment "local-bdd-observability-disabled" for stack "nvcf-compute-plane" from fixture "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd.yaml" with values:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |
      | global.helm.sources.repository  | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | global.image.repository         | ${SAMPLE_NGC_ORG}/${SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM} |
      | observability.profile           | disabled                             |
    # Seed the compute stack's registration handoff without contacting ICMS.
    # The Make target copies this input to OUTPUT_DIR before Helmfile evaluates it.
    And I copy the file "tests/bdd/fixtures/ncp-local-register-values.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/registration/ncp-local-register-values.yaml"

  Scenario: Disabled profile renders no observability resources
    When I run command:
      """
      make -C deploy/stacks/self-managed template HELMFILE_ENV=local-bdd-observability-disabled OUTPUT_DIR=${REPO_ROOT}/tests/bdd/out/observability-disabled/control-plane
      """
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    When I run command:
      """
      make -C deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane template CLUSTER_NAME=ncp-local HELMFILE_ENV=local-bdd-observability-disabled OUTPUT_DIR=${REPO_ROOT}/tests/bdd/out/observability-disabled/compute-plane
      """
    Then the command exit code should be 0

    Then the rendered manifests in "tests/bdd/out/observability-disabled" should not contain:
      | text                         |
      | name: function-autoscaler    |
      | kind: OpenTelemetryCollector |
      | kind: ServiceMonitor         |
      | kind: PodMonitor             |
      | BYOObservability             |
